# General Comments

*** These comments are meant to improve your code in future iterations, I will
go into more detail in our one on one. ***

- Modularize your files.  I think this is the next step to level up you coding.
I can see you started but it looks like you just said "fuck it". It can be very
useful for readability and also when you start to work on a team. (Not to
mention when other people are reading./ reviewing your code).

- Try to stick to ES6.  You make use of the ES6 "fat arrow" but go back to
using var.  They are different [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/let-keyword-vs-var-keyword).

- Great coommenting, makes things very readable.

- See diff for more details.
